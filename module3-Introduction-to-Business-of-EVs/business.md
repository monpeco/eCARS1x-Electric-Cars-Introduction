Introduction to Electric Vehicle Mobility Business
In the previous week, we saw  the key parts of an electric car and understood the important roles played by the traction battery, the electric motor and the power electronic converters. We also saw the different types of electric vehicles and followed it up with charging infrastructure for electric cars. 

Several questions that will be addressed in this module are:

* Were electric cars already present at the beginning of the automotive era?
* What makes the car so popular and why should it be electrified now?
* What are the unique features of an Electric Vehicle?
* Why is electrification the most important sustainable disruption in mobility?
* How is the acceptance of automated driving in different countries? 
* Why is connectivity an important part of electric mobility?
* What are the challenges ahead for Electric Mobility?

In this module, we attempt to answer the above questions. The main topics covered this week are :

* Business essential - The battery and motor
* Future of mobility
* Gartner hype cycles
* Main drivers for urban mobility
* Emissions and Big three urban polluters
* Regenerative braking
* City congestions
* Self-driving cars
* Automation
* Public and private car sharing
* Total cost of ownership
* Mobility as a Service

For this module we have made another glossary of terms.

#### 3. Introduction to Business of EVs   3.2 Electrification, a sustainable business disruption   Lecture 2: Electrification, A Sustainable disruption


The efficiency of electric vehicles is already three times better than combustion vehicles and the difference is only going to increase in the future. Is this the only reason why we should switch to electric mobility? No, there are many other critical ones and this lecture will talk about them in detail.

Also, this lecture from Frank will help you answer the following questions:

* Why is electrification the most important sustainable disruption in mobility?
* What are the main drivers for urban mobility? 
* Are emissions starting to be unacceptable from a standpoint of Health?
* Who are the main polluters in the urban environment?
* What are the unique features of Electric Vehicle?

#### 3. Introduction to Business of EVs   3.4 Connectivity makes auto-mobility cost efficient   Lecture 4: Connectivity makes auto-mobility cost efficient

Electric Mobility will not be a cost but an income. How is this possible? Is this even true?  Yes, but it’s all possible only with connectivity. Also, business-wise, the most challenging disruption is connectivity! 

Frank Rieck will help you answer the below questions:

* Why is connectivity an important part of electric mobility?
* Can we earn money with empty vehicles? 
* Should car ownership cost as much as a house?
* Will electric cars become as cheap as combustion engine car?
* What are the challenges ahead for Electric Mobility?

#### 3. Introduction to Business of EVs   3.5 Summary   Summary

To start summarizing this week, first,  you were introduced to the business of Electric Vehicles. We then saw in detail the different disruptions - electrification, automation and connectivity.  

We saw that electric cars were already present at the beginning of automotive era. In 1900, they engineered an in-wheel electric motor which is still regarded as very advanced today. We looked at few of today’s EV manufacturers - Volt, Tesla, Nikola. The European driving scheme was also explained and how it will support the trucking industry. In the Gartner hype cycles, we saw that three positive technologies , autonomous cars, electric vehicles and car sharing, are coming together in one decade. 

In the second lecture, we saw that electrification is the most important positive sustainable disruption.  We understood the need for electrification by studying the current situation of urban mobility. Citizens are looking for good air quality, less traffic noise and less congestions. We saw that electric mobility could be the solution for it. We are spilling our resources and improved usage of solar energy could lead to energy positive vehicles in the future. Regenerative braking is an another step towards energy positive vehicles. Finally, fast charging infrastructure fed with 100% renewable energy is needed.

Smart e-mobility is possible only when electrification and automation come together. Traffic congestions and hence cost of congestions could drastically be brought down in the case of smart e-mobility. Also, mobility without accidents is possible. But for both of these to happen, acceptance of automated driving and master plan for mobility are crucial. We then saw the examples of Park Shuttle in Rotterdam Airport and AGV in Rotterdam harbour. Smart e-mobility is promising and at the EU level, it will give an 1 million additional jobs in the year 2030 and many more across the world! 

In the final section, we saw that driving empty is a waste of cost and through connectivity, the total cost of ownership can be shared among many consumers. The examples of Car2Go, Prototype e-truck in Rotterdam and Picnic was discussed to support this. We looked that at 2022, EV’s will break even because of the economies of scale in the battery production and supply chain for the EV parts. This means that EV’s will have about the same showroom price as an internal combustion engine vehicle. To summarize, we have seen three disruptions, electrification, automation and connectivity, with six zeros connected to it – zero emission, zero energy, zero congestion, zero accident, zero empty and zero cost.

In the next week, we will delve deeper into the policy aspects of EVs. Till then, we will leave you with these activities that will connect all the concepts you learnt this week. All the best!
