Introduction to Electric Vehicle Mobility Business
In the previous week, we saw  the key parts of an electric car and understood the important roles played by the traction battery, the electric motor and the power electronic converters. We also saw the different types of electric vehicles and followed it up with charging infrastructure for electric cars. 

Several questions that will be addressed in this module are:

* Were electric cars already present at the beginning of the automotive era?
* What makes the car so popular and why should it be electrified now?
* What are the unique features of an Electric Vehicle?
* Why is electrification the most important sustainable disruption in mobility?
* How is the acceptance of automated driving in different countries? 
* Why is connectivity an important part of electric mobility?
* What are the challenges ahead for Electric Mobility?

In this module, we attempt to answer the above questions. The main topics covered this week are :

* Business essential - The battery and motor
* Future of mobility
* Gartner hype cycles
* Main drivers for urban mobility
* Emissions and Big three urban polluters
* Regenerative braking
* City congestions
* Self-driving cars
* Automation
* Public and private car sharing
* Total cost of ownership
* Mobility as a Service

For this module we have made another glossary of terms.

#### 3. Introduction to Business of EVs   3.1 Electric Vehicle Mobility Business   Lecture 1: Introduction to Electric Vehicle Mobility Business

### Lecture 1: Introduction to Electric Vehicle Mobility Business


Did you know that the first in-wheel motor electric & hybrid car in the world was made in 1900 itself? 

Yes, you will be hearing more such interesting content in today’s lecture by Frank G. Rieck, Applied Research Professor - Future Mobility. He will be introducing you to electric vehicle mobility business. Also, this lecture will help you answer the following questions:

* Were electric cars already present at the beginning of the automotive era?
* Where is the power source for today’s electrification?
* VOLTA, TESLA and NIKOLA – What are they doing currently?
* What makes the car so popular and why should it be electrified now?
* What are the three positive disruptive technologies are coming together in this decade?

#### 3. Introduction to Business of EVs   3.2 Electrification, a sustainable business disruption   Lecture 2: Electrification, A Sustainable disruption


The efficiency of electric vehicles is already three times better than combustion vehicles and the difference is only going to increase in the future. Is this the only reason why we should switch to electric mobility? No, there are many other critical ones and this lecture will talk about them in detail.

Also, this lecture from Frank will help you answer the following questions:

* Why is electrification the most important sustainable disruption in mobility?
* What are the main drivers for urban mobility? 
* Are emissions starting to be unacceptable from a standpoint of Health?
* Who are the main polluters in the urban environment?
* What are the unique features of Electric Vehicle?
