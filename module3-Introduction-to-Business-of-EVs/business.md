Introduction to Electric Vehicle Mobility Business
In the previous week, we saw  the key parts of an electric car and understood the important roles played by the traction battery, the electric motor and the power electronic converters. We also saw the different types of electric vehicles and followed it up with charging infrastructure for electric cars. 

Several questions that will be addressed in this module are:

* Were electric cars already present at the beginning of the automotive era?
