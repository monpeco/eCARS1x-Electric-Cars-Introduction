#### 4. Introduction to Policy for EVs   4.0 Introduction   Introduction

Welcome on-board this module on ‘Policy for EVs’. So far you have learnt about the technology and business aspects of EVs. An important question we must ask at this point is: Can an environmentally conscious society and the entrepreneurial spirit of a free market work together to achieve the transition to clean and sustainable mobility on their own? Do we really need help from governments?
 
The answer to this fundamental question will become clear in this module. Not only do we look at the role of governments, but we also seek to understand the various policy instruments available to governments if intervention is deemed necessary. Furthermore, the electricity and transport sectors are discussed from the perspective of infrastructure systems. We seek to understand how these vital pillars of the economy would probably respond to the disruptive influence of electric mobility. And finally, we conclude with a lecture on how the transition to electric mobility could impact the behaviour and choices of citizens.


In this module, we will cover the following main topics :

* Policy ambitions – public health, climate, energy, transport, economy
* Role of government intervention
* Policies and policy instruments
* Air quality standards and role of zero-emission vehicles
* Interactions between technology, economy and society
* Convergence of infrastructures (energy, transport, IT/telecoms)
* Coherence of technology and institutions

Discussion forum :

The government and its role, the ability to bring about change, is perceived differently by different people. That's why we want to ask you: Can the transition to clean and sustainable mobility be achieved without government intervention? 
Let us know your thoughts by posting in the discussion forum. Think of real-life examples from your country where government intervention has helped and others where it has failed.
