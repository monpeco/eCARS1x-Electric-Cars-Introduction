Lecture 1: Role of EVs in the energy transition

We have all noticed that electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular. The automobile manufacturers are developing it, the market is promoting it, and the policy is supporting it. At the same time, there is a move from fossil fuels towards renewable and sustainable sources of energy such as solar and wind. In this lecture by Professor Pavol Bauer, we will look at the key benefits of electric vehicles: sustainability, efficiency, convenience and economics. We will also discuss the role of electric vehicles in the energy transition.

A short history of EV
To get a historical context of the EV development, it is good to see a timeline of EV. The image below presents an overview of the most important dates and events which concern the development of electric vehicles from 1830 to 2016. You can also download the timeline here.

As an important note, battery electric vehicles are often referred to by several names : electric vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles, all electric vehicles or pure electric vehicles. All these names do not have the word ‘hybrid’ in them. We will see next module what these hybrid electric vehicles are.

Lecture 3: Policy Perspective

In the next lecture by Professor Margot Weijnen, we get a glimpse into the world of public policy making and the role of government in promoting electric vehicles. The lecture seeks to give you an overview of the policy dimension of EVs. In module 4 of this course we will explore in greater depth this aspect of public policy initiatives for EVs.  After watching this lecture you should be able to answer the following questions: 

What is the role of the transport sector in the national economy through the example of the Netherlands?
Why is government intervention necessary in the transition to electric mobility?
How are the transport and electricity sectors interlinked?
What is the aim of government intervention in the transport and electricity sector?
Governments seek to balance conflicting policy goals. How different policy areas require different kinds of intervention?

#### 1. EVs in the Energy Transition   1.3 Policy Perspective of EV   Lecture Notes and Discussion

### Lecture Notes and Discussion

So you have just been provided with a host of reasons why government intervention in the transport sector is so essential in this period of transition. But how do different governments react? The answer to this question will indeed depend on which part of the world you are living in. This [link](http://www.eafo.eu/content/netherlands) gives a very nice summary of the status of electric vehicles in the Netherlands. 


Scroll down to the bottom of the page and under the heading “Country incentives Netherlands” you can learn how the Dutch government is incentivizing electric vehicles. This is one form of government intervention but nonetheless very important. Well, this is how we do it in the Netherlands, but we’d also like to know what your government is doing to promote electric mobility. We encourage you to share this knowledge with your fellow learners by posting in the discussion forum.

#### 1. EVs in the Energy Transition   1.4 Combining Perspectives   Introduction

### Introduction

In this section of this module, you can watch our panel discussion about how the three perspectives of technology, business and policy are key to the growth of EVs. The panelists are the instructors you have previously met during the course: Professor Pavol Bauer for the technology perspective, Professor Frank Rieck for the business perspective, and Professor Margot Weijnen for the policy perspective. The panel is moderated by the course coordinator: Gautham Ram Chandra Mouli. Gautham Ram is as a postdoctoral researcher at Delft University of Technology working on electric cars and their charging technology.

The panel discussion is cut into five parts, each with a distinct question. These are:

1. Why should I buy an electric car?
2. When will the price of electric cars become lower than that of gasoline cars, i.e. When are EVs cheaper?
3. Range anxiety is still an issue with EVs. How can technology, policy and business help overcome this challenge, i.e. how to overcome the fear of an empty battery?
4. How would electric vehicles contribute to our economy and what will change in the business model, i.e. How do EVs change the economy?
5. Why are the three perspectives of technology, policy and business required for the uptake of EVs, i.e. Why take these three perspectives?

#### 1. EVs in the Energy Transition   1.4 Combining Perspectives   1. Why should I buy an electric car?

### 1. Why should I buy an electric car?

**Why should I, as a common man, buy an electric vehicle today?**

Well from the technological perspective, it is clear that electric vehicle is environmentally friendly.
It has a significantly higher efficiency than combustion engine vehicle.

Aside from that we have less need for the regular maintenance but there is some small
maintenance but much less than the combustion engine because there are significantly less
moving parts

 there are also other advantages like there is no noise produced from the engine,
 
 it can easily accelerate, you can accelerate as a supercar
 
 it doesn't rely
on fossil fuels, therefore it can contribute to energy transition


**from a business perspective, I should buy an electric vehicle today?**

At the end it's more cost-effective, it's cheaper.

Already now you see that for buses and some trucks where they make total cost of ownership calculations,
they find that the vehicles today, the electric vehicles today,
can compete with the traditional diesel trucks and buses.

But also for the private user, businessmen, it will be cheaper in the end.
It's not the sticker price of course, which at this moment is higher
than the traditional vehicle, but you see that you can earn this difference back in a very short period of time.

**from a policy perspective why should I buy electric car today.**

from a public policy perspective, government has many reasons
to convince people to buy electric cars.
Especially in cities and along major transport corridors,
we see that public health suffers a lot from traffic and pollution.

So for the sake of cleaner air, electric cars are a great choice.

Moreover, electric vehicles nicely fit in with energy transition goals
and with climate policy goals, as my colleagues already pointed out.

As we have seen in many countries, rebates on the purchasing price and fiscal incentives
have been quite effective you know, so far in stimulating the sales of electric cars.

The downside of this, however, is that as soon as you remove those financial incentives,
you know, sales stagnate immediately.

What we have also learned, I think, from the scheme supplied so far,
is that we have to make a clear distinction between just private drivers and the ones, you know,
who drive for business and buy their car, you know, as a business asset.


They have a very different behavior and the latter group, where the car is a business asset,
is far more rational in its decision making on the buying of an electric car,
than the general, you know, private car owner is.

### 2. When are EVs cheaper?

**When will the purchase price of an electric car become equal to or even lower than the gasoline car in the future and how will technology, policy and business will help in doing that?**

Tech: It will very soon, I am expecting around 2025, the purchase price becomes cheaper
than classical combustion engine car. May be sooner.

The reason for that is the development of technology,
in fact, the biggest price part of the car is the battery price.
We saw that in last five years that there is a huge dive in the battery price.
Just five years ago, 1 Kilowatt per hour of battery was almost 1000 dollars.
Now we have at the level of 200 and its still going down with mass production,

There is another driver apart from the mass production of all parts,

interchangeability also is an important factor and the advances in power electronics and energy conversion

Business: It’s all about economies by lack of scale.
You could say, it's a new technology.
If you look at the production numbers, they are sometimes one-offs
and in many cases now its small series.

However, the statement that the sticker price is higher is even not true today,
because if you look at the Tesla Model S, its mentioned before,
and you compare with the Maserati with the same acceleration, looks and quality.
The Maserati is more expensive than the Tesla Model S to buy.

And now, the last years, you see that private lease is coming up.
You can private lease, for instance, a Nissan Leaf already for below 400 Euro
and if you look at that price, which is in fact the total cost of ownership price,

but then in the lease contract its cheaper than the competition and that’s because the energy is included.
So, the electricity and the fastened fast charging is included so it's already cheap.
So, i think 2022 is certainly the breakeven

Policy: I think, you know, we are talking about when are electric cars really the cheapest alternative,
the best alternative in the mass car market.

It is evident though, that governments around the world
have been very active to make electric mobility competitive.
The sooner, the better!

governments have been investing a lot in research, development and demonstration programmes
to speed up the introduction of electric vehicles in the market.

For governments, what is the complicating factor is that there are more interests
at stake than just stimulating electric cars for air quality reasons
or energy transition reasons or climate policy reasons.

There are also things such as economic policy, which includes industrial policy and the government
also has to protect established industrial interest.

But, the governments and the national industrial champions are now competing
for the future electric vehicle market in terms of technology leadership, manufacturing facilities
and that is mainly because of employment opportunities involved.

One of the signals for here is, for instance, Maroš Šefčovič, one of the vice-presidents
of the European Commission, in October 2017, he announced that Europe is going to make billions
of Euros available to support the establishment of large scale battery manufacturing facilities in Europe
and that is with the aim to create 4 to 5 million new jobs.

Tech: a very important point and it is automatic vehicle driving.
This will also from a technology point of view completely change the usage of vehicle.
You can imagine that you are coming home, getting out of the car, which is driving automatically,
and the car itself goes to the charging spot somewhere nearby, maybe even further away,
charging itself and stays ready again when you need it.
