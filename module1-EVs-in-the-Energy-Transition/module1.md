Lecture 1: Role of EVs in the energy transition

We have all noticed that electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular. The automobile manufacturers are developing it, the market is promoting it, and the policy is supporting it. At the same time, there is a move from fossil fuels towards renewable and sustainable sources of energy such as solar and wind. In this lecture by Professor Pavol Bauer, we will look at the key benefits of electric vehicles: sustainability, efficiency, convenience and economics. We will also discuss the role of electric vehicles in the energy transition.

A short history of EV
To get a historical context of the EV development, it is good to see a timeline of EV. The image below presents an overview of the most important dates and events which concern the development of electric vehicles from 1830 to 2016. You can also download the timeline here.

As an important note, battery electric vehicles are often referred to by several names : electric vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles, all electric vehicles or pure electric vehicles. All these names do not have the word ‘hybrid’ in them. We will see next module what these hybrid electric vehicles are.

#### 1. EVs in the Energy Transition   1.2 Business Perspective of EV   Lecture 2: Business Perspective

Lecture 2: Business Perspective

In the next lecture by Frank G. Rieck, Applied Research Professor - Future Mobility, we will investigate the role of Electric Vehicles (EV) in energy transition from a business perspective. This lecture will help you answer the following questions:

From a business perspective, what are the factors that form the economic triangle?
How can we safeguard our health and wealth by using affordable clean energy?
Why should we make the transition to renewable energy?
What are the solutions for electrification of road transport?
Why should we switch to Electric Vehicles from Internal combustion vehicles?

Enjoy the lecture!
