Lecture 1: Role of EVs in the energy transition

We have all noticed that electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular. The automobile manufacturers are developing it, the market is promoting it, and the policy is supporting it. At the same time, there is a move from fossil fuels towards renewable and sustainable sources of energy such as solar and wind. In this lecture by Professor Pavol Bauer, we will look at the key benefits of electric vehicles: sustainability, efficiency, convenience and economics. We will also discuss the role of electric vehicles in the energy transition.

#### 1. EVs in the Energy Transition   1.1 Technology Perspective of EV   Lecture Notes

A short history of EV
To get a historical context of the EV development, it is good to see a timeline of EV. The image below presents an overview of the most important dates and events which concern the development of electric vehicles from 1830 to 2016. You can also download the timeline here.

As an important note, battery electric vehicles are often referred to by several names : electric vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles, all electric vehicles or pure electric vehicles. All these names do not have the word ‘hybrid’ in them. We will see next module what these hybrid electric vehicles are.

Lecture 2: Business Perspective

In the next lecture by Frank G. Rieck, Applied Research Professor - Future Mobility, we will investigate the role of Electric Vehicles (EV) in energy transition from a business perspective. This lecture will help you answer the following questions:

From a business perspective, what are the factors that form the economic triangle?
How can we safeguard our health and wealth by using affordable clean energy?
Why should we make the transition to renewable energy?
What are the solutions for electrification of road transport?
Why should we switch to Electric Vehicles from Internal combustion vehicles?

#### 1. EVs in the Energy Transition   1.3 Policy Perspective of EV   Lecture 3: Policy Perspective

Lecture 3: Policy Perspective

In the next lecture by Professor Margot Weijnen, we get a glimpse into the world of public policy making and the role of government in promoting electric vehicles. The lecture seeks to give you an overview of the policy dimension of EVs. In module 4 of this course we will explore in greater depth this aspect of public policy initiatives for EVs.  After watching this lecture you should be able to answer the following questions: 

What is the role of the transport sector in the national economy through the example of the Netherlands?
Why is government intervention necessary in the transition to electric mobility?
How are the transport and electricity sectors interlinked?
What is the aim of government intervention in the transport and electricity sector?
Governments seek to balance conflicting policy goals. How different policy areas require different kinds of intervention?

#### 1. EVs in the Energy Transition   1.3 Policy Perspective of EV   Lecture Notes and Discussion

### Lecture Notes and Discussion

So you have just been provided with a host of reasons why government intervention in the transport sector is so essential in this period of transition. But how do different governments react? The answer to this question will indeed depend on which part of the world you are living in. This [link](http://www.eafo.eu/content/netherlands) gives a very nice summary of the status of electric vehicles in the Netherlands. 


Scroll down to the bottom of the page and under the heading “Country incentives Netherlands” you can learn how the Dutch government is incentivizing electric vehicles. This is one form of government intervention but nonetheless very important. Well, this is how we do it in the Netherlands, but we’d also like to know what your government is doing to promote electric mobility. We encourage you to share this knowledge with your fellow learners by posting in the discussion forum.

#### 1. EVs in the Energy Transition   1.4 Combining Perspectives   Introduction

### Introduction

In this section of this module, you can watch our panel discussion about how the three perspectives of technology, business and policy are key to the growth of EVs. The panelists are the instructors you have previously met during the course: Professor Pavol Bauer for the technology perspective, Professor Frank Rieck for the business perspective, and Professor Margot Weijnen for the policy perspective. The panel is moderated by the course coordinator: Gautham Ram Chandra Mouli. Gautham Ram is as a postdoctoral researcher at Delft University of Technology working on electric cars and their charging technology.

The panel discussion is cut into five parts, each with a distinct question. These are:

1. Why should I buy an electric car?
2. When will the price of electric cars become lower than that of gasoline cars, i.e. When are EVs cheaper?
3. Range anxiety is still an issue with EVs. How can technology, policy and business help overcome this challenge, i.e. how to overcome the fear of an empty battery?
4. How would electric vehicles contribute to our economy and what will change in the business model, i.e. How do EVs change the economy?
5. Why are the three perspectives of technology, policy and business required for the uptake of EVs, i.e. Why take these three perspectives?

#### 1. EVs in the Energy Transition   1.4 Combining Perspectives   1. Why should I buy an electric car?

### 1. Why should I buy an electric car?

**Why should I, as a common man, buy an electric vehicle today?**

Well from the technological perspective, it is clear that electric vehicle is environmentally friendly.
It has a significantly higher efficiency than combustion engine vehicle.

Aside from that we have less need for the regular maintenance but there is some small
maintenance but much less than the combustion engine because there are significantly less
moving parts

 there are also other advantages like there is no noise produced from the engine,
 
 it can easily accelerate, you can accelerate as a supercar
 
 it doesn't rely
on fossil fuels, therefore it can contribute to energy transition


**from a business perspective, I should buy an electric vehicle today?**

At the end it's more cost-effective, it's cheaper.

Already now you see that for buses and some trucks where they make total cost of ownership calculations,
they find that the vehicles today, the electric vehicles today,
can compete with the traditional diesel trucks and buses.

But also for the private user, businessmen, it will be cheaper in the end.
It's not the sticker price of course, which at this moment is higher
than the traditional vehicle, but you see that you can earn this difference back in a very short period of time.

**from a policy perspective why should I buy electric car today.**

from a public policy perspective, government has many reasons
to convince people to buy electric cars.
Especially in cities and along major transport corridors,
we see that public health suffers a lot from traffic and pollution.

So for the sake of cleaner air, electric cars are a great choice.

Moreover, electric vehicles nicely fit in with energy transition goals
and with climate policy goals, as my colleagues already pointed out.

As we have seen in many countries, rebates on the purchasing price and fiscal incentives
have been quite effective you know, so far in stimulating the sales of electric cars.

The downside of this, however, is that as soon as you remove those financial incentives,
you know, sales stagnate immediately.

What we have also learned, I think, from the scheme supplied so far,
is that we have to make a clear distinction between just private drivers and the ones, you know,
who drive for business and buy their car, you know, as a business asset.


They have a very different behavior and the latter group, where the car is a business asset,
is far more rational in its decision making on the buying of an electric car,
than the general, you know, private car owner is.
