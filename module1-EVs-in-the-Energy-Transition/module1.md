Lecture 1: Role of EVs in the energy transition

We have all noticed that electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular. The automobile manufacturers are developing it, the market is promoting it, and the policy is supporting it. At the same time, there is a move from fossil fuels towards renewable and sustainable sources of energy such as solar and wind. In this lecture by Professor Pavol Bauer, we will look at the key benefits of electric vehicles: sustainability, efficiency, convenience and economics. We will also discuss the role of electric vehicles in the energy transition.

#### 1. EVs in the Energy Transition   1.1 Technology Perspective of EV   Lecture Notes

A short history of EV
To get a historical context of the EV development, it is good to see a timeline of EV. The image below presents an overview of the most important dates and events which concern the development of electric vehicles from 1830 to 2016. You can also download the timeline here.

As an important note, battery electric vehicles are often referred to by several names : electric vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles, all electric vehicles or pure electric vehicles. All these names do not have the word ‘hybrid’ in them. We will see next module what these hybrid electric vehicles are.

#### 1. EVs in the Energy Transition   1.2 Business Perspective of EV   Lecture 2: Business Perspective

Lecture 2: Business Perspective

In the next lecture by Frank G. Rieck, Applied Research Professor - Future Mobility, we will investigate the role of Electric Vehicles (EV) in energy transition from a business perspective. This lecture will help you answer the following questions:

From a business perspective, what are the factors that form the economic triangle?
How can we safeguard our health and wealth by using affordable clean energy?
Why should we make the transition to renewable energy?
What are the solutions for electrification of road transport?
Why should we switch to Electric Vehicles from Internal combustion vehicles?

Enjoy the lecture!

### Lecture Notes

This MOOC has two types of reading material - obligatory and additional reading material. Please read the obligatory course material carefully. You are free to read the additional material to gain a deeper understanding of the subject. However, the 'additional material' is outside of scheduled study load of 4 hours per week.

Required reading
The introduction (Section 1) of: [Frank G. Rieck et al.- Automotive, the Future of Mobility](http://pure.tudelft.nl/ws/files/28904823/EVS30_Paper_10310638_Automotive_the_Future_of_Mobility.pdf)

The article above, written by the Frank G.Rieck et al., will be used in two modules: the current module I1 and the upcoming module I3. The article is published in the EVS30 International Battery, Hybrid and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle Symposium, but you can use the link above to directly download the article. Only the introduction is required reading material.

Additional reading
You may, of course, read the whole article by Frank G. Rieck et al. on Automotive, the future of Mobility linked to above.

#### 1. EVs in the Energy Transition   1.3 Policy Perspective of EV   Lecture 3: Policy Perspective

Lecture 3: Policy Perspective

In the next lecture by Professor Margot Weijnen, we get a glimpse into the world of public policy making and the role of government in promoting electric vehicles. The lecture seeks to give you an overview of the policy dimension of EVs. In module 4 of this course we will explore in greater depth this aspect of public policy initiatives for EVs.  After watching this lecture you should be able to answer the following questions: 

What is the role of the transport sector in the national economy through the example of the Netherlands?
Why is government intervention necessary in the transition to electric mobility?
How are the transport and electricity sectors interlinked?
What is the aim of government intervention in the transport and electricity sector?
Governments seek to balance conflicting policy goals. How different policy areas require different kinds of intervention?
