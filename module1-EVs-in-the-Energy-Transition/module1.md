Lecture 1: Role of EVs in the energy transition

We have all noticed that electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular. The automobile manufacturers are developing it, the market is promoting it, and the policy is supporting it. At the same time, there is a move from fossil fuels towards renewable and sustainable sources of energy such as solar and wind. In this lecture by Professor Pavol Bauer, we will look at the key benefits of electric vehicles: sustainability, efficiency, convenience and economics. We will also discuss the role of electric vehicles in the energy transition.

A short history of EV
To get a historical context of the EV development, it is good to see a timeline of EV. The image below presents an overview of the most important dates and events which concern the development of electric vehicles from 1830 to 2016. You can also download the timeline here.

As an important note, battery electric vehicles are often referred to by several names : electric vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles, all electric vehicles or pure electric vehicles. All these names do not have the word ‘hybrid’ in them. We will see next module what these hybrid electric vehicles are.

#### 1. EVs in the Energy Transition   1.3 Policy Perspective of EV   Lecture Notes and Discussion

### Lecture Notes and Discussion

So you have just been provided with a host of reasons why government intervention in the transport sector is so essential in this period of transition. But how do different governments react? The answer to this question will indeed depend on which part of the world you are living in. This [link](http://www.eafo.eu/content/netherlands) gives a very nice summary of the status of electric vehicles in the Netherlands. 


Scroll down to the bottom of the page and under the heading “Country incentives Netherlands” you can learn how the Dutch government is incentivizing electric vehicles. This is one form of government intervention but nonetheless very important. Well, this is how we do it in the Netherlands, but we’d also like to know what your government is doing to promote electric mobility. We encourage you to share this knowledge with your fellow learners by posting in the discussion forum.

#### 1. EVs in the Energy Transition   1.4 Combining Perspectives   Introduction

### Introduction

In this section of this module, you can watch our panel discussion about how the three perspectives of technology, business and policy are key to the growth of EVs. The panelists are the instructors you have previously met during the course: Professor Pavol Bauer for the technology perspective, Professor Frank Rieck for the business perspective, and Professor Margot Weijnen for the policy perspective. The panel is moderated by the course coordinator: Gautham Ram Chandra Mouli. Gautham Ram is as a postdoctoral researcher at Delft University of Technology working on electric cars and their charging technology.

The panel discussion is cut into five parts, each with a distinct question. These are:

1. Why should I buy an electric car?
2. When will the price of electric cars become lower than that of gasoline cars, i.e. When are EVs cheaper?
3. Range anxiety is still an issue with EVs. How can technology, policy and business help overcome this challenge, i.e. how to overcome the fear of an empty battery?
4. How would electric vehicles contribute to our economy and what will change in the business model, i.e. How do EVs change the economy?
5. Why are the three perspectives of technology, policy and business required for the uptake of EVs, i.e. Why take these three perspectives?

#### 1. EVs in the Energy Transition   1.4 Combining Perspectives   1. Why should I buy an electric car?

### 1. Why should I buy an electric car?

**Why should I, as a common man, buy an electric vehicle today?**

Well from the technological perspective, it is clear that electric vehicle is environmentally friendly.
It has a significantly higher efficiency than combustion engine vehicle.

Aside from that we have less need for the regular maintenance but there is some small
maintenance but much less than the combustion engine because there are significantly less
moving parts

 there are also other advantages like there is no noise produced from the engine,
 
 it can easily accelerate, you can accelerate as a supercar
 
 it doesn't rely
on fossil fuels, therefore it can contribute to energy transition


**from a business perspective, I should buy an electric vehicle today?**

At the end it's more cost-effective, it's cheaper.

Already now you see that for buses and some trucks where they make total cost of ownership calculations,
they find that the vehicles today, the electric vehicles today,
can compete with the traditional diesel trucks and buses.

But also for the private user, businessmen, it will be cheaper in the end.
It's not the sticker price of course, which at this moment is higher
than the traditional vehicle, but you see that you can earn this difference back in a very short period of time.

**from a policy perspective why should I buy electric car today.**

from a public policy perspective, government has many reasons
to convince people to buy electric cars.
Especially in cities and along major transport corridors,
we see that public health suffers a lot from traffic and pollution.

So for the sake of cleaner air, electric cars are a great choice.

Moreover, electric vehicles nicely fit in with energy transition goals
and with climate policy goals, as my colleagues already pointed out.

As we have seen in many countries, rebates on the purchasing price and fiscal incentives
have been quite effective you know, so far in stimulating the sales of electric cars.

The downside of this, however, is that as soon as you remove those financial incentives,
you know, sales stagnate immediately.

What we have also learned, I think, from the scheme supplied so far,
is that we have to make a clear distinction between just private drivers and the ones, you know,
who drive for business and buy their car, you know, as a business asset.


They have a very different behavior and the latter group, where the car is a business asset,
is far more rational in its decision making on the buying of an electric car,
than the general, you know, private car owner is.

#### 1. EVs in the Energy Transition   1.4 Combining Perspectives   2. When are EVs cheaper?

### 2. When are EVs cheaper?

**When will the purchase price of an electric car become equal to or even lower than the gasoline car in the future and how will technology, policy and business will help in doing that?**

Tech: It will very soon, I am expecting around 2025, the purchase price becomes cheaper
than classical combustion engine car. May be sooner.

The reason for that is the development of technology,
in fact, the biggest price part of the car is the battery price.
We saw that in last five years that there is a huge dive in the battery price.
Just five years ago, 1 Kilowatt per hour of battery was almost 1000 dollars.
Now we have at the level of 200 and its still going down with mass production,

There is another driver apart from the mass production of all parts,

interchangeability also is an important factor and the advances in power electronics and energy conversion

Business: It’s all about economies by lack of scale.
You could say, it's a new technology.
If you look at the production numbers, they are sometimes one-offs
and in many cases now its small series.

However, the statement that the sticker price is higher is even not true today,
because if you look at the Tesla Model S, its mentioned before,
and you compare with the Maserati with the same acceleration, looks and quality.
The Maserati is more expensive than the Tesla Model S to buy.

And now, the last years, you see that private lease is coming up.
You can private lease, for instance, a Nissan Leaf already for below 400 Euro
and if you look at that price, which is in fact the total cost of ownership price,

but then in the lease contract its cheaper than the competition and that’s because the energy is included.
So, the electricity and the fastened fast charging is included so it's already cheap.
So, i think 2022 is certainly the breakeven

Policy: I think, you know, we are talking about when are electric cars really the cheapest alternative,
the best alternative in the mass car market.

It is evident though, that governments around the world
have been very active to make electric mobility competitive.
The sooner, the better!

governments have been investing a lot in research, development and demonstration programmes
to speed up the introduction of electric vehicles in the market.

For governments, what is the complicating factor is that there are more interests
at stake than just stimulating electric cars for air quality reasons
or energy transition reasons or climate policy reasons.

There are also things such as economic policy, which includes industrial policy and the government
also has to protect established industrial interest.

But, the governments and the national industrial champions are now competing
for the future electric vehicle market in terms of technology leadership, manufacturing facilities
and that is mainly because of employment opportunities involved.

One of the signals for here is, for instance, Maroš Šefčovič, one of the vice-presidents
of the European Commission, in October 2017, he announced that Europe is going to make billions
of Euros available to support the establishment of large scale battery manufacturing facilities in Europe
and that is with the aim to create 4 to 5 million new jobs.

Tech: a very important point and it is automatic vehicle driving.
This will also from a technology point of view completely change the usage of vehicle.
You can imagine that you are coming home, getting out of the car, which is driving automatically,
and the car itself goes to the charging spot somewhere nearby, maybe even further away,
charging itself and stays ready again when you need it.

#### 1. EVs in the Energy Transition   1.4 Combining Perspectives   3. How to overcome range anxiety?

### 3. How to overcome range anxiety?

** how can technology, policy and business help in overcoming this range anxiety problem with electric cars?**

 I think this arrange anxiety has two important sides.
One is the mindset and the other one is the technology but let's have a look at the mindset.
I like to compare it to the mobile phone and this mobile phone which I have now,
I have to charge it every day even if I use it extensively twice a day
because I see the great advantage of this technology and, this is the mindset.

So, we have to really get used to that to the idea that charging often is some part of our mobility plan.

The technological part is partly infrastructure which is a charging infrastructure,
the charger itself and, it's a chicken-and-egg problem.
So, we have to really get more charging spots in order to get more cars.

The drop in the battery price
also takes care that the car itself will have a battery with the higher capacity
and, if I have a car with the hundred kilowatt hours battery capacity, I can drive 500 kilometers
which is comparable to the combustion engine filled up car driving range.

Business: range anxiety in fact it's a transition problem I think and a serious problem.

we are four centuries used to traveling about one hour per day
and that average is already possible with an electric car but that's not enough, of course.
There are cases that you have to travel long distances and drive more than you like to drive normally

There are already good solutions for that.
The range extended vehicles
which there are in several forms for passenger cars but also for buses and trucks.

They create another anxiety and that's fuel anxiety and those drivers get used to the luxury of electric driving
and they hate to go to the pub because that's costing money
and costing time, travel time, so if you can do it smarter with a full electric vehicle
they would love to do that and maybe in the extreme cases,
the fuel cell electric vehicle is also a solution to get no anxiety in the end.

I think the nicest example at this moment in time
is what's happening at this moment in the trucking industry.
The trucking industry was always said it's impossible to make an electric vehicle
which fits the application of a truck and that's proven not true

and, the city distribution you see very nice examples
that an electric truck is more effective than a diesel truck
that can do a lot of other things but driving in a city is not the best value,

There are already positive business cases there and, even for the long-haul
which is not in fact long-haul, but long distance that you have to drive to deliver your cargo,
it's so that if you have one driver, the driver has to stop by the regulation of driving time
and resting periods in Europe and that's after three hours and a half an hour,
they have to stop for 45 minutes and we know that scheme
from supercharging of the unit Tesla Model S and X already.

Another point that we learned from the Tesla semi is that one big handicap of trucks is
that they cannot take hills very good.

The traditional track sometimes drops to 30 kilometres an hour
but the electric truck is so powerful that it keeps that 80 kilometres an hour.
That's time and in the business it's all about this time.

Tech: I like to add one very exciting technological concept which is on-road charging,
using contactless charging for charging while driving.
This concept can greatly contribute to the range anxiety.

Policy: You know it's about adopting new routines and that change you know in our behavior
is probably a much tougher challenge than making the new technology
and the new infrastructure timely available
and in many countries, we do already see that governments
you know, California's one example are co-funding the rollout of charging infrastructure
but then if they do this, you know they usually don't do it only for battery electric vehicles you know.
Governance usually refrain from making a choice between different technologies
so they usually also support the roll out of hydrogen refueling infrastructure
for fuel cell electric cars

but, besides you know actual co-funding it's even more important that government
sets the rules of the game for the industries that are competing for this new market

and one of the issues here is, you know, it's not only technical standards
but it's also the charging protocol for electric vehicles.
Now for example, the Netherlands has adopted what we call an open charging protocol.

You can compare it I think with the roaming agreements that exists between telecom providers
but what good is the open charging protocol
if our European neighbors and the rest of Europe do not adopt it?

#### 1. EVs in the Energy Transition   1.4 Combining Perspectives   4. How do EVs change the economy?

### 4. How do EVs change the economy?

**what do you think that electric vehicles can do for our economy and what will be the change in the business models from a country perspective right and why should we go towards that?**

Tech: I think that the contribution especially to energy transition, the transition to renewable energies,
is really huge and, I would like to say that, for example,
the storage capacity of electric vehicles now the best ones is about hundred kilowatt hours
for vehicle can mean a huge capacity for storing the energy
from the wind or solar or other sources from your energies

and, this contribution can be huge and, also cost saving can be also important.
For example, if I calculate that we have now more than seven million vehicles in the Netherlands
and if 1 million from them will be electrical vehicle with the huge capacity of hundred kilowatt hours,
then we are coming to the capacity of 100 Giga watt hours
and now the peak power in Netherlands is about 35 gigawatts.

So, we can cover the whole country energy needs for more than 3 hours by energy vehicles.
Of course, you need to have a technology for that.
For example, a vehicle to grid we are developing in the university in Delft such a technology,
but this is something which will change the whole landscape also for the private user.
It can be that the houses or the user can be more energy neutral.

Business: Electric vehicles are three to four times as efficient as the combustion vehicle in practice.
So, you're saving a lot of energy and if you make an electric vehicle capable for storing energy
or even harvesting energy like the startup company Lightyear is planning to do.

It's earning money standing still and maybe even driving.
Self-driving vehicles are anyhow earning money anyhow.
50% of the cost of transportation is the chauffeur.

The nice thing of electric vehicles is that there are also the platform for optimization
and, I already talked about driverless vehicles, autonomous vehicles.
They are easy to automate and easy to connect to each other.
So, road trains completely driverless or accidents can be avoided.


Traffic jams can be avoided by automation.
So, that's a very important economic value for the future and if you add that up
electrification, automation and maybe even sharing
that we make smarter use of the capacity of passenger cars or trucks.
Trucks are driving for more than 50% empty.
That's not transportation I would say.
Then you could imagine that during this century that apart from the investment,
that the transportation cost of man and good could be for free and, that is saving a lot of cost
and cost and money is what is available for other more added value missions

Policy: preventing premature deaths
that are caused by bad air quality does contribute to the economy.
You know healthy people that live longer can contribute more to the economy and to society.

We should also not underestimate to what extent clean air may become an important factor
and to attract talented people and innovative businesses to our cities you know
and both are key to economic growth in the future

are going to be places where you can only move around if not by you know, bike or walking,
where you can only move around with you know, electric mobility.

around the world are doing to develop applications or for example blockchain technology
to accommodate the almost real-time interactions of electric vehicles
that are being recharged with the electricity system.
