Lecture 1: Role of EVs in the energy transition

We have all noticed that electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular. The automobile manufacturers are developing it, the market is promoting it, and the policy is supporting it. At the same time, there is a move from fossil fuels towards renewable and sustainable sources of energy such as solar and wind. In this lecture by Professor Pavol Bauer, we will look at the key benefits of electric vehicles: sustainability, efficiency, convenience and economics. We will also discuss the role of electric vehicles in the energy transition.
